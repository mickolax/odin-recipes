# introduction (before starting)

This is the first project in the TOP Foundations curriculum, focusing on HTML skills.

Goal is to create a simple page with some favorite recipes listed on it.

# reflection (after completion)

This was my second time doing this project. Last time was 4 years ago, so there might have been slight differences.

I think the biggest difference is that last time I was working on a Ubunutu VC, and this time on MacOS. Also, I don't remember using the VS Code terminal last time, which was super convenient for making git commits, compared to jumping between the built-in terminal.

It was fun though. Looking forward to next ones.
